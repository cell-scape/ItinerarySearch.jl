# ItinerarySearch Development Diary

## 2026-03-23 — MCT Full SSIM8 Matching
- **Scope**: Expanded the MCT lookup to support all SSIM8 Chapter 8 matching fields
- **Changes**:
  - MCTRecord: 15 new fields (codeshare ind/op_carrier, aircraft type, flight number ranges, state geography, date validity, suppression geography)
  - 10 new MCT_BIT_* bitmask constants (bits 12-21)
  - `_compute_specificity` reweighted to full 29-level SSIM8 hierarchy
  - `_mct_record_matches` expanded from 11 to 23 parameters
  - `lookup_mct` signature expanded with 14 new kwargs, date validity pre-filter, suppression geography scope
  - MCTLookup key changed from `StationCode` to `Tuple{StationCode,StationCode}` for inter-station support
  - `inter_station_default = Minutes(240)` fallback for cross-airport connections
  - MCTRule passes full SSIM8 context (codeshare status, operating carrier, equipment, flight number, geography, target date)
  - Materialization SQL and `_build_mct_record` updated to populate all new fields
  - Comprehensive test suite: 8 new test categories covering all matching dimensions
- **Tests**: 1132 total (187 MCT lookup tests)
- **Deferred**: Inter-station connection building (pairing arrivals/departures across metro airports)

## 2026-03-17 — Project scaffolding
- **Notes**: Initial project creation. No measurements yet.
